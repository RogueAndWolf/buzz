/**
 * Guard for the shipping bridge that carries the composed profile state to the
 * Instances section. The behavioral composition + section test
 * (ProfileInstancesArchived.test.mjs) proves resolveManagedProfileState buckets
 * correctly and ProfileInstancesSection renders the Archived subsection, but it
 * feeds the section directly and so cannot see either bucket being dropped on
 * the way there. In production that path is a three-hop prop chain —
 * UserProfilePanel -> ProfileSummaryView -> ProfileRuntimeTabContent ->
 * ProfileInstancesSection — so a single-file guard would leave two hops
 * unverified. The six prop-handoff pins below pin BOTH the live and archived
 * props at each hop: the panel consumes the single composition and maps both
 * buckets, and each intermediate component forwards both props onward.
 * Replacing any hop's mapping with `[]` fails here even though every behavioral
 * test stays green.
 *
 * Correct forwarding only reaches the UI if the two archived-aware visibility
 * gates in that same path stay archived-aware: the `showRuntimeTab` gate
 * (ProfileSummaryView) that decides whether the Runtime tab renders, and the
 * `hasInstances` gate (ProfileRuntimeTabContent) that decides whether
 * ProfileInstancesSection renders. For an all-archived persona
 * `archivedInstances.length > 0` is the ONLY true operand of each gate.
 *
 * These gates are covered by MOUNTING the two intermediate components with a
 * realistic all-archived owner-bot persona and asserting the rendered UI, not
 * by analysing their source. Mounting ProfileSummaryView asserts the Runtime
 * tab (`user-profile-tab-runtime`) is present for one and for two archived rows
 * and absent for none; mounting ProfileRuntimeTabContent asserts
 * ProfileInstancesSection renders the archived rows for one and for two
 * archived rows and self-omits for none. Because the assertion is the actual
 * rendered outcome, it is indifferent to how the gate expression is written —
 * operand order, parenthesisation, and dead decoy declarations are all
 * irrelevant, while any mutation that strands an all-archived persona (operator
 * swap, deleted/commented clause, dead conjunction, or a shape that only holds
 * for one structurally invalid row) hides the asserted UI and fails here. This
 * is why the persona fixtures are realistic `ManagedAgent`-shaped rows with
 * real pubkeys, and why both one-row and two-row cases are exercised.
 *
 * The fixtures also model the two navigation shapes an archived persona is
 * reached through, so a gate conditioned on either shape is caught: the summary
 * mount uses the persona-target shape (`isSelf: false`, `pubkey: null` — a
 * persona with no primary managed agent computes `isSelf: false` in
 * production), and the runtime mount covers both persona-target navigation
 * (`currentPubkey: null`) and the explicit-pubkey path (`currentPubkey` set to
 * an archived row, the route used to unarchive an identity).
 *
 * Mounting the two intermediates requires importing their modules, which
 * transitively load AgentSessionTranscriptList — that reads
 * `import.meta.env.VITE_SHOW_TRANSCRIPT_ACP_SOURCE` at module-evaluation time.
 * The shared node test loader (`desktop/test-loader-hooks.mjs`) now shims
 * `import.meta.env` to the vite build shape so any module that reads a `VITE_*`
 * key at import time evaluates cleanly under the node harness.
 *
 * Coverage boundary: six prop handoffs (two buckets x three hops) + these two
 * visibility gates. ProfileInstancesSection is the terminal consumer and is
 * covered behaviorally by ProfileInstancesArchived.test.mjs. Together these are
 * the complete set of archived-aware expressions in the shipping chain — the
 * four chain files hold no other archived-aware condition outside them.
